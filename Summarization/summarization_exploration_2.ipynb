    "\n",
    "## Abstractive Summarization Models\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of this notebook, there are 3 state of the art abstractive text summarization models: \n",
    "1. Pegasus\n",
    "2. T5\n",
    "3. BART\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than comparing all 3 in this notebook, I have chosen to focus on BART.  BART has been shown to slightly outperform the others for summarization tasks (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7720861/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## BART Models\n",
    "\n",
    "BART (https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) was trained on a number of tasks.  There is no single BART model on HuggingFace for all of the training tasks presented in the paper, rather a bunch of models that are trained on the specific tasks.  For summarization, you can find BART models on HuggingFace that were trained on the following datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* CNN/DailyMail - Dataset of news articles.  The summaries in this dataset resemble the source sentences and extractive summarization models perform well here.  BART beat all previous benchmarks. Use model ID = \"facebook/bart-large-cnn\"\n",
    "* XSUM - Dataset of news articles.  The summaries in this dataset are highly abstract and generally much shorter than the original text.  Abstractive summarization models perform well here.  BART beat all previous benchmarks.  Use model ID = \"facebook/bart-large-xsum\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are 2 model choices, the one you should use depends on what you want the summarizer to do.  If it should be very high level and very short, go with XSUM.  If it should be more detailed but capture the basics of the parent text, then go with CNN.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "Both models have distilled versions (smaller models for faster inference).  Since these models will be used in production environments, inference speed is important.  For this reason, I will evaluate the distilled versions of the models in this notebook.  Metrics showing how the distilled models compare to the full sized (baseline) models can be found here: https://huggingface.co/sshleifer/distilbart-xsum-12-6#metrics-for-distilbart-models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic quantization can be used to further reduce the model size and increase inference speed.  Pytorch makes this extremely simple with a 1-liner.  Quantization compresses the weights of a pre-trained model without much impact to model performance.  See an example with Pytorch here: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/dynamic_quantization_bert_tutorial.html.\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Constrained beam search tends to make the summaries worse.  They read better when the model is allowed to generate the summary without influence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Summaries are not guaranteed to have correct information.  Sometimes they make no sense.  Other times they directly contradict the original text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The summaries seem to get worse with fewer sentences, partly because the model starts predicting words from outside the domain of the article.  Paragraph level summarization is likely not feasible at this time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## What HuggingFace Has to Say\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently HuggingFace has no extractive summarization models.  There are open feature requests for them, and the consensus is that abstractive summarizers are too risky to use in production, because they can produce sentences that do not make sense or are blatently false.  \n",

    "## Extractive Summarization Models\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of this notebook, there are several state of the art extractive summarization models.  They are evaluated using Rouge scores: R1, R2, RL.  The current leader is MatchSum, and its code is available here: https://github.com/maszhongming/MatchSum.  MatchSum does not have a ready-to-run form though, so there are 2 other models shown for comparison that do have ready-to-run forms, where they can simply be downloaded and called in a library.  \n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | R1 | R2 | RL | Model Size (Mb) |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| MatchSum (RoBERTa-base) | 44.41 | 20.86 | 40.55 | 816 |\n",
    "| Distil-RoBERTa | 42.87 | 20.02 | 39.31 | 935 |\n",
    "| Mobile BERT | 42.01 | 19.31 | 38.53 | 282 |\n",
    "\n",
    "There are larger versions of RoBERTA and BERT, but the distilled and mobile versions are smaller, faster, and have comparable Rouge scores.  So I have chosen to focus on Mobile BERT in this notebook.  Their Rouge scores came from: https://transformersum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extractive/models-results.html.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Rouge score explanation: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-rouge-and-how-it-works-for-evaluation-of-summaries-e059fb8ac840/\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mobile BERT\n",
    "\n",
    "Mobile BERT comes from the TransformerSum package, which can be found here: https://github.com/HHousen/TransformerSum.  It is designed to run like a HuggingFace model.  It was trained on the following datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* CNN/DailyMail - Dataset of news articles.  The summaries in this dataset resemble the source sentences and extractive summarization models perform well here. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas distil BERT compresses by reducing model depth, mobile BERT compresses by reducing model width.  Both methods result in faster inference.  Since these models will be used in production environments, inference speed is important. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic quantization can be used to further reduce the model size and increase inference speed.  Pytorch makes this extremely simple with a 1-liner.  Quantization compresses the weights of a pre-trained model without much impact to model performance.  See an example with Pytorch here: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/dynamic_quantization_bert_tutorial.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Preparing the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "I pulled the transformersum package's src folder from: https://github.com/HHousen/TransformerSum/tree/master/src, copied it into the directory with this notebook, and renamed it to transformersum, because there is no way to easily install it with pip.  Then I downloaded the model checkpoint from https://transformersum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extractive/models-results.html#pretrained-ext and saved it to the models/mobile_bert_extr folder.  "
