    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summarization Models\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of this notebook, there are 3 state of the art text summarization models: \n",
    "1. Pegasus\n",
    "2. T5\n",
    "3. BART\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than comparing all 3 in this notebook, I have chosen to focus on BART.  BART has been shown to slightly outperform the others for summarization tasks (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7720861/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## BART Models\n",
    "\n",
    "BART (https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) was trained on a number of tasks.  There is no single BART model on HuggingFace for all of the training tasks presented in the paper, rather a bunch of models that are trained on the specific tasks.  For summarization, you can find BART models on HuggingFace that were trained on the following datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* CNN/DailyMail - Dataset of news articles.  The summaries in this dataset resemble the source sentences and extractive summarization models perform well here.  BART beat all previous benchmarks. Use model ID = \"facebook/bart-large-cnn\"\n",
    "* XSUM - Dataset of news articles.  The summaries in this dataset are highly abstract and generally much shorter than the original text.  Abstractive summarization models perform well here.  BART beat all previous benchmarks.  Use model ID = \"facebook/bart-large-xsum\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are 2 model choices, the one you should use depends on what you want the summarizer to do.  If it should be very high level and very short, go with XSUM.  If it should be more detailed but capture the basics of the parent text, then go with CNN.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "Both models have distilled versions (smaller models for faster inference).  Since these models will be used in production environments, inference speed is important.  For this reason, I will evaluate the distilled versions of the models in this notebook.  Metrics showing how the distilled models compare to the full sized (baseline) models can be found here: https://huggingface.co/sshleifer/distilbart-xsum-12-6#metrics-for-distilbart-models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic quantization can be used to further reduce the model size and increase inference speed.  Pytorch makes this extremely simple with a 1-liner.  Quantization compresses the weights of a pre-trained model without much impact to model performance.  See an example with Pytorch here: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/dynamic_quantization_bert_tutorial.html.\n",
